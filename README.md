# RedLight-BlueLight
Red Light Blue Light is a computer vision-based referee system for the game Red Light, Green Light. Using YOLOv3, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques, the system detects player movement to determine eliminations. Additionally, we explore reinforcement learning to develop optimal strategies for winning the game.
